# TTPMS (Tire Temperature and Pressure Monitoring System)
Wireless Tire Temperature and Pressure Monitoring System using Bluetooth Low Energy on NRF52 platform with Zephyr RTOS.

Developed for University of Calgary Schulich Racing for use in 2022 and beyond as a reimagining of the previous concept (https://github.com/lukegarland/ttpms) with digital sensors for faster and higher resolution data, longer battery life, and over-the-air tuning and configuration.

Notable hardware:
-NRF52833 SoC
-NRF52840 SoC
-MLX90641 IR Temperature Array
-MLX90621 IR Temperature Array
-ILPS22QS Pressure Sensor
